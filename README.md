## The Idea
>We're making a dynamic scheduling app based on machine learning that uses a reinforced learning pattern to understand the user's productive hours and suggest a schedule. Essentially, it will take your timetable and schedule studying / working time around it. After using it for a certain period of time (we're keeping it 2 weeks) and inputting what time blocks the user follows (ex: they studied from 4-5 pm but not 5-6 pm as the algorithm previously suggests, so the algorithm tries to suggest a new time). Over time it would predict your naturally productive hours and help you schedule your time more effectively.
