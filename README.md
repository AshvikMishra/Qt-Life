We're making a dynamic scheduling app based on machine learning that uses a reinforced learning pattern to understand the user's productive hours and suggest a schedule. After using it for a certain period of time (we're specifying it to 2 weeks) and inputting what time blocks the user follows. Over time it would predict your naturally productive hours and help you schedule your time more effectively.
