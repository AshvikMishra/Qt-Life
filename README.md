## The Pitch
[Visit our pitch](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGRdCsp-Gw/Qh2OSSBYz-MrnldQOE2YxA/view)

##  The Story
Have you ever made a timetable and could not really stick to it? Have you browsed the web for the most productive hours of the day and they did not work for you. Well you're in lucky, becuase this application can help you find those hours and supercharge your productivity!

## The Idea
We're making a dynamic scheduling app based on machine learning that uses a reinforced learning pattern to understand the user's productive hours and suggest a schedule. After using it for a certain period of time and inputting what time blocks the user follows. Over time it would predict your naturally productive hours and help you schedule your time more effectively.
